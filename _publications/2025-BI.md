excerpt: "Treating EBI as a modular micro-lesson pattern, we linked test names, contexts, distributions, graphs, and scenarios into equivalence classes, yielding near-ceiling post/maintenance performance and transfer to written tests. The results motivate low-touch onboarding in learning platforms where a few well-scaffolded interactions unlock derived knowledge at scale."
