excerpt: "Using the IRAP as a rapid, interaction-level measure, we quantified general gender stereotypes among Japanese university students, revealing robust stereotype-congruent responding. The findings inform bias-aware interface design and evaluation, where latency/accuracy signals can surface implicit attitudes without relying on self-report."
