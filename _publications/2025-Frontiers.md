excerpt: "Using a smart-clothing ECG, we evaluated the feasibility of one-month, home-based nocturnal HRV monitoring in a preschooler with ASD and linked nightly physiology with caregiver-reported behaviors. Beyond null prediction results, the study surfaces actionable HCI design constraints—tolerability, adherence, and end-to-end data pipelines—for long-term sensing systems in naturalistic pediatric care."
