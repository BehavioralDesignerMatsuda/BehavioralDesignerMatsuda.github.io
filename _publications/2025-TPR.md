excerpt: "By showing that tact + intraverbal training (I-BiN) suffices for emergent equivalence, this study motivates scaffolded micro-lessons that convert minimal teaching moves into derived knowledge. Latency traces reveal when learners shift away from verbal mediation, informing adaptive fading in intelligent tutors."
