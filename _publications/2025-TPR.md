excerpt: "This brief replication asked whether tact training plus baseline intraverbal training—arranged to evoke intraverbal bidirectional naming (I-BiN)—is sufficient to produce derived stimulus–stimulus and intraverbal relations consistent with equivalence. Eleven Japanese-speaking university students completed tact training, listener tests, and intraverbal training before posttests using vocal match-to-sample (MTS) and intraverbal probes. Ten participants showed emergent performances across both tasks. Latency patterns during vocal MTS suggested an initial reliance on verbal mediation (trained or self-generated tacts/intraverbals) that diminished over time, and post-session interviews indicated heterogeneous strategies combining verbal links (e.g., familiarity-based associations) with visual imagery. Overall, the findings support I-BiN as a sufficient route to equivalence class formation while highlighting individual differences in mediational processes."
