<!-- ここから本文（英語のAbout） -->
Soichiro Matsuda is an Assistant Professor at the University of Tsukuba and directs the Behavioral Design Lab. His work sits at the intersection of **HCI and behavioral science**, moving **from lab to field** to design multimodal systems that **measure, model, and improve human–human interaction** in real-world contexts.

# About

**Soichiro Matsuda, Ph.D.**  
Assistant Professor (Tenure), Institute of Human Sciences, University of Tsukuba  
Principal Investigator, **Behavioral Design Laboratory**

**One-liner.** I design and evaluate **interactive systems for human–human interaction**, combining **Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA)** with **HCI** through **sensing-driven assessment** and **technology-enhanced interventions**.

**Short bio.**  
Soichiro Matsuda is an Assistant Professor at the University of Tsukuba and PI of the Behavioral Design Lab. His work sits at the intersection of **HCI and behavioral science**, creating and studying systems that quantify social behavior and deliver **adaptive feedback** in real-world settings. He focuses on early intervention for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), parent-mediated training, and the **design of human–human interaction** using wearables, XR, socially assistive robots, and low-burden sensing. Methodologically, he blends **single-case designs** with user-centered HCI methods and open, reproducible workflows.
