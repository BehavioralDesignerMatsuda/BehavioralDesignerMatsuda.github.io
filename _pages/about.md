# About

**Soichiro Matsuda, Ph.D.**  
Assistant Professor (Tenure), Institute of Human Sciences, University of Tsukuba  
Principal Investigator, **Behavioral Design Laboratory**

**One-liner.** I design and evaluate **interactive systems for human–human interaction**, combining **Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA)** with **HCI** through **sensing-driven assessment** and **technology-enhanced interventions**.

**Short bio (≈90 words).**  
Soichiro Matsuda is an Assistant Professor at the University of Tsukuba and PI of the Behavioral Design Lab. His work sits at the intersection of **HCI and behavioral science**, creating and studying systems that quantify social behavior and deliver **adaptive feedback** in real-world settings. He focuses on early intervention for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), parent-mediated training, and the **design of human–human interaction** using wearables, XR, socially assistive robots, and low-burden sensing. Methodologically, he blends **single-case designs** with user-centered HCI methods and open, reproducible workflows.

## Research focus

- **Interactive systems for social support.** Technology-enhanced coaching and training for ASD (parent-facing tools, therapist support dashboards).  
- **Sensing & measurement.** Eye movements, posture/voice/activity, and **multimodal social signals** to quantify interaction in-the-wild.  
- **Adaptive feedback & behavior change.** Closed-loop interventions grounded in **ABA**, evaluated with **single-case experimental designs** plus mixed-methods HCI evaluation.  
- **Platforms.** Wearables and smart clothing, **XR/VR**, socially assistive robots, and lightweight **edge AI** for privacy-aware, low-friction deployment.  
- **Accessibility & inclusion.** Designing with neurodivergent stakeholders; emphasis on practical tools that translate to classrooms and clinics.

**Keywords:** Human–Computer Interaction; Human–Human Interaction design; ASD; technology-assisted intervention; social signal sensing; parent-mediated training; single-case designs (SCD); in-the-wild studies; XR; socially assistive robotics; behavior change.
