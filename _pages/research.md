# Research Focus

**Mission.** Established in 2020 at the University of Tsukuba, the Behavioral Design Laboratory studies **human interaction** and designs futures where **diversity is not treated as disability**. Grounded in **Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA)**, we use **single-case experimental designs** and **psychological experiments** to systematically analyze behavior. To **describe, predict, and influence** social interaction, we work across disciplines and institutions, integrating **computer vision, wearable devices, socially assistive robots, motion capture, and smart clothing**. Through interdisciplinary collaboration and real-world implementations, we aim to create **inclusive environments** and **bridge behavioral science and society** by turning evidence into practical solutions.

### 1) Designing Behavior in Autism Support (InfoTech × PsychTech)
We measure and modify behavior in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), especially when social interaction is challenging—developing and evaluating **technology-enhanced behavior support systems** that combine information science and psychology.

**Selected lines of work**
- Mechanisms of **contingent imitation** via acoustic analysis  
- **Wearable-based feedback** to increase social engagement  
- Measuring **self-injurious behavior** with accelerometers  
- **Remote parent support** using a behavioral observation app  
- Quantifying **classroom social interaction** with computer vision  
- Interfaces for **gaze visualization** to assess social communication  
- Facilitating **social play** with paired robotic devices  
- Capturing & augmenting **face-to-face behavior** using wearables  
- Monitoring **sleep HRV** with smart clothing  
- Modeling **therapist–child interpersonal distance** via motion capture

### 2) Designing Behavior in Dyadic Spoken Interaction
We identify determinants of **interaction quality** in real-world dyadic conversations and design more effective, adaptive patterns of interpersonal communication.

**Selected lines of work**
- Effects of **supervisor training** on 1-on-1 meetings in organizations  
- Impact of **face visibility** on response behavior among individuals with a history of **selective mutism**  
- **Behavioral skills training** (BST) for **simulated job interviews**  
- BST targeting **how people receive feedback**  
- Effects of **face visibility in video calls** on task engagement  
- Discriminative function of others’ **approach/avoidance** as a consequence of **visual fixation**

### 3) Designing Verbal Behavior: Integrating Theory, Learning, and Everyday Use
Building on **Skinner’s Verbal Behavior**, we study how language acquires and generalizes **new stimulus functions**, from efficient learning procedures to long-term, everyday language use.

**Selected lines of work**
- Comparing learning conditions for **untrained stimulus relations** in foreign-vocabulary acquisition  
- Effects of **rehearsal** and **articulatory suppression** on language learning  
- **Experience Sampling Method (ESM)** predictors of daily well-being  
- **Equivalence-based instruction (EBI)** for learning statistical hypothesis testing  
- Exploring **gender stereotypes** with the **Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP)**  
- Developing the Japanese version of the **Evasive Attitudes of Sexual Orientation Scale**
